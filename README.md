## Mobile App Setup (React Native)

To create the mobile project, run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
npx react-native init mobile
```

This will generate a new React Native app inside the `mobile/` directory.

### Building and running

Navigate to the `mobile/` folder and use the React Native CLI to run the app:

```bash
cd mobile
npx react-native run-android   # or run-ios on macOS
```
